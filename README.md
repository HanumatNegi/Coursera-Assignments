# Coursera-Assignments
Hello my name is Hanumat Singh Negi, I am student at Doon university Dehradun, Uttrakhand, India.
This is the reposatory made to complete my all the assignments of my first coursera course on HTML,CSS,and Javascript.
Why do this course?
After animations , my interest is on web development whether it is on front end or on back end and i love to create some basic test websites.
My motive behind joining this course is to expand my knowledge and make some real-time websites which are more facinating when i look into their codes whether it is mix of HTML And CSS or mix of all HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

In future too i will be joining different courses like C, C++, Java, PHP etc. but firstly i want to make my own website on which i can proudly say this is the website that i created.
Thhankyou â˜º.
